PART 3:
1. Possible reasons they might not enjoy it could include that it does not load fast enough or the fact that it rerenders the page to only include information for that location, and no way to return.
2. The first thing that should be implemented is a back button to return to all locations. Another thing would be to start storing the data in a noSQL database, making the read times faster.
